# Demo

There are now several unrelated things in the repo. They are no longer only for developers.

The "main attraction" here is a [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com) plugin which implements a few VCV Rack synthesizer modules. It's intended to demonstrate how to make a basic VCV Rack plugin rather than an actual "useful" synthesizer module. It can be found [here](./demo-readme.md).

The other things here are some papers on different aspects of using VCV and measuring the performance of VCV.

Here is a high level table of contents:

1. [The demo VCOs](./demo-readme.md)
2. [Using the CPU meters in VCV Rack](./docs/cpu-meters.md)
