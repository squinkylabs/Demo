# Demo

There are now several unrelated things in the repo. Most will be of interest to VCV users and developers.

The "main attraction" here is a [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com) plugin which implements a few VCV Rack synthesizer modules. It's intended to demonstrate how to make a basic VCV Rack plugin rather than an actual "useful" synthesizer module. It can be found [here](./demo-readme.md). The documentation that accompanies it talks a lot about aliasing, and how to get rid of it in a VCO. It also talks about methods to reduce CPU usage.

The other things here are some papers on different aspects of using VCV and measuring the performance of VCV.

We hope to keep general information in this repo, instead of putting it into the main SquinkyLabs VCV Module repo.
